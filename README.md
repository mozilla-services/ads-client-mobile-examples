# Ads Client Mobile Examples

## Overview

This repo contains example Android and iOS apps which demonstrate integration with the Application Services `ads-client` component.

The purpose of these examples are to provide developers with references as to how someone might go about using the `ads-client` Rust component in a real-world app, and additionally provide a space for testing and controlled debugging of the component locally.

This repo is still under construction so not all example applications are complete or in a working state.

For help setting up these example apps locally, see `./docs/local_setup.md`.
